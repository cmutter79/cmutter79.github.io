<h1>How AI Has Reshaped the Way I Work and Think</h1>

<p>I’ve been thinking recently about how AI has completely changed the way I interact with the internet, and I’m amazed at how fast it all happened. In just two months, the way I search, brainstorm, and get work done feels completely different. And honestly, I can’t imagine going back.</p>

<p>AI-powered capabilities have been baked into many of the products I’ve worked on, but it’s not something I was using directly in my personal or professional life. When ChatGPT launched, I dabbled, but I didn’t fully grasp how powerful it was, or what it would become. I was more focused on what it could do for our users than how I could be using it myself.</p>

<p>That changed recently at work where I started kicking the tires more seriously. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using Copilot for competitive analysis</li>
  <li>Analyzing win/loss feedback to uncover trends</li>
</ul>

<p>These tools worked well and saved time, but still weren’t part of my daily routine.</p>

<p>Since stepping away from that role, my use of AI tools like ChatGPT has completely transformed. It’s now a daily companion — part personal assistant, part resume and interview coach, part vibe coding buddy and teacher, and part sounding board. Sometimes it feels like I’m just dumping ideas into the void to see what comes back — and more often than not, it’s providing sharper, clearer results than I ever got with search.</p>

<h2>The Shift to Conversational Search and NLX</h2>

<p>After watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/o8NiE3XMPrM?si=Y26em1SrQNrEoJns" target="_blank">Google I/O</a> and seeing how deeply Gemini is being integrated into search, it’s clear they’re seeing the same behavior shift: <strong>People want to interact, not just search.</strong></p>

<p>Many of the other announcements blew me away and gave us a glimpse of where the puck is going. The more I use AI, the more I think we’re at a true inflection point — maybe even bigger than the original rise of Google itself. <em>Chat-first is becoming the new default.</em></p>

<p>On Lenny's Podcast <a href="https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/microsoft-cpo-on-ai" target="_blank">this week</a> there was a great conversation with Aparna Chennaprageda where they even discussed "NLX" as the new UX representing natural language experience. Hearing how much thought goes into how intentional the interactions are is fascinating, given how natural they feel.</p>

<h2>A Glimpse Into the Future</h2>

<p>With <a href="https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/" target="_blank">OpenAI’s announcement</a> about teaming up with Jony Ive on new hardware, it just further reinforces that change is coming fast.</p>

<h2>A Word of Caution</h2>

<p>Of course, not everything is perfect. I’m more relaxed using these tools in my personal life than I would be with sensitive corporate data. It’s important to strike the right balance about:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>What goes in and what doesn’t</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Transparency on data access and use</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Verifying outputs rather than accepting agreeable responses - See: <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/" target="_blank">GPT-4o and sycophancy</a></strong><br>
    (Side note: I do miss how encouraging ChatGPT was being)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The changes are coming at lightning speed, and it’s important for companies to figure out how to adopt this technology <strong>securely and responsibly</strong>.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>As for me — I’m only scratching the surface, but I can’t wait to dig deeper.</p>

<p>What about you? How has AI changed the way you work and think? I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
