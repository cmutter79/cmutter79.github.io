I’ve been thinking recently about how AI has completely changed the way I interact with the internet, and I’m amazed at how fast it all happened. In just two months, the way I search, brainstorm, and get work done feels completely different. And honestly, I can’t imagine going back.

AI-powered capabilities have been baked into many of the products I’ve worked on, but it’s not something I was using directly in my personal or professional life. When ChatGPT launched, I dabbled, but I didn’t fully grasp how powerful it was, or what it would become. I was more focused on what it could do for our users than how I could be using it myself.

That changed recently at work where I started kicking the tires more seriously. For example:

- Using Copilot for competitive analysis  
- Analyzing win/loss feedback to uncover trends  

These tools worked well and saved time, but still weren’t part of my daily routine.

Since stepping away from that role, my use of AI tools like ChatGPT has completely transformed. It’s now a daily companion — part personal assistant, part resume and interview coach, part vibe coding buddy and teacher, and part sounding board. Sometimes it feels like I’m just dumping ideas into the void to see what comes back — and more often than not, it’s providing sharper, clearer results than I ever got with search.

## The Shift to Conversational Search

After watching [Google I/O](https://www.youtube.com/live/o8NiE3XMPrM?si=Y26em1SrQNrEoJns) and seeing how deeply Gemini is being integrated into search, it’s clear they’re seeing the same behavior shift:  
**People want to interact, not just search.**

Many of the other announcements blew me away and gave us a glimpse of where the puck is going. The more I use AI, the more I think we’re at a true inflection point — maybe even bigger than the original rise of Google itself. *Chat-first is becoming the new default.*

## A Glimpse Into the Future

With [OpenAI’s announcement](https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/) about teaming up with Jony Ive on new hardware, it just further reinforces that change is coming fast.

## A Word of Caution

Of course, not everything is perfect. I’m more relaxed using these tools in my personal life than I would be with sensitive corporate data. It’s important to strike the right balance about:

- **What goes in and what doesn’t**  
- **Transparency on data access and use**  
- **Verifying outputs rather than accepting agreeable responses**  
  ([See: GPT-4o and [sycophancy](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/)])

The changes are coming at lightning speed, and it’s important for companies to figure out how to adopt this technology **securely and responsibly**.

## Looking Ahead

As for me — I’m only scratching the surface, but I can’t wait to dig deeper.
