<p>>Hi! I’m Curtis.</p>

<p>I'm a seasoned product leader with over 15 years of experience shaping B2B software across a wide swath of industries — from digital forensics to projection mapping to broadcast graphics. I’ve led teams, worked with some of the best engineers around, scaled products, and shipped features that help people do incredibly complex work using incredibly powerful tools. I care deeply about building technology that’s thoughtful and practical. I also bring curiosity (yes, I will ask a lot of questions), thoughtfulness, and a healthy appreciation that there’s always more to learn.</p>

<p>I’m especially passionate about building products that help people. That’s what gets me up in the morning. I thrive in collaborative environments where every voice counts and where the best ideas win (not just the loudest ones). Whether it's untangling a tricky user flow or shipping something that makes someone say "finally!", I aim to build products that both delight and deliver.</p>

<p>This site is where I share what I’m learning as I explore how product and AI are intersecting, along with some thoughts from the job hunt trenches. Expect a mix of insights, questions, and the occasional hot take. Thanks for dropping by.</p>
